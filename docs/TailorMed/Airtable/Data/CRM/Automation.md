# Automation

This database currently does not include any active Automations.  
However, this section is intentionally reserved to document future workflow automations that may be introduced to support operational efficiency and reduce manual work.

In the context of the TailorMed CRM, Automations will typically be used to:

- Streamline quotation-related processes
- Maintain data accuracy across linked tables
- Trigger notifications or reminders based on status changes
- Generate or update records automatically to support logistics workflows
- Synchronize business rules between the CRM and external systems such as the FIN Base or OMS

When Automations are added in the future, this section will provide:

- The automation name
- Its trigger conditions
- A description of each action executed
- The tables and fields affected
- A business-level explanation of the workflow it supports

This reserved space ensures the documentation remains complete and ready for expansion as the CRM evolves.
